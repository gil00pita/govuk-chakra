# Interruption pages

Pause a journey only when users must understand unusually important information or confirm a significant consequence before continuing.

## Example in this repository

- Storybook: **GOV.UK / Patterns / Pages / Interruption pages**
- Story ID: `gov-uk-patterns-pages--interruption-pages`
- [Open in local Storybook](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/gov-uk-patterns-pages--interruption-pages)
- [Interactive implementation](../../../src/stories/patterns/Pages.tsx)
- [Story and implementation notes](../../../src/stories/patterns/Pages.stories.tsx)
- [All patterns](README.md)

## When to use

- Use when the user must notice information that materially changes whether or how they continue.
- Use when a potentially surprising answer needs an explicit confirmation before a high-impact action.

## When not to use

- Do not interrupt routine journeys for ordinary guidance, marketing, reassurance or information that can appear at the point of need.
- Do not use interruption styling as a generic visual emphasis treatment.

## Journey and implementation rules

- State the issue as the page heading, show the relevant value or consequence and provide one clear primary continuation action.
- Offer a plainly worded secondary route to go back or correct the information.
- Use the official interruption Panel variant and inverse controls without inventing new colours or urgency levels.

## Accessibility and service safeguards

- Keep both decisions keyboard accessible with descriptive labels that state their consequences.
- Do not rely on the panel colour to communicate importance and do not trap focus or block the browser back action.

## Demo and production responsibilities

The local Panel has no dedicated interruption variant. The example composes its existing colour props with inverse controls. Confirm the consequence warrants an interruption and use tested production copy.

## Reference

Intent and safeguards are based on the supplied `govuk-design-md` pattern reference reviewed 9 September 2026. Check the [GOV.UK pattern guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/interruption-pages/) when adapting this example for a live service.
